# Whenner [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/avdgaag/whenner.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/avdgaag/whenner)

## Introduction

A promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `done` and `fail`
methods, which registers callbacks to receive either a promiseâ€™s eventual value
or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

## Installation

Whenner is distributed as a Ruby gem, which should be installed on most Macs and
Linux systems. Once you have ensured you have a working installation of Ruby
and Ruby gems, install the gem as follows from the command line:

    $ gem install whenner

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version
   unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have
   your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
   ignore when I pull)
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
